# common-functions-JS
A library of commonly used functions so we never have to write the same function again

## This is a ongoing project and will be updated as more functions are added.
Feel free to send me a message or fork this repository and add your own functions!

### This is a list of all the functions present in this library
	- IsDevEnd. This function splits any link and checks it agaisnt a number of commonly used denominators of a development build. Such as "localhost", "dev.somelink.com" and etc.

	- ShortHash. This simple function accepts any long ID or web3 hash and creates a small version of it to be more user friendly when presenting information on screen.

	- SeparateLink. This function split any link into the most common delimiters (".", "/", ":"), returning the link into an array form.

### If you wish to edit the lists on which the functions work, you can check HOW-TO-CUSTOMIZE-FUNCTIONS file.
